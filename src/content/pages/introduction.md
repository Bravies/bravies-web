Creating a safe and predictable environment at home is a crucial step in helping your child manage anxiety. Hereâ€™s how you can foster a sense of security and stability:

#### Establish a Routine

- **Consistency is Key**: Regular routines for meals, homework, and bedtime provide structure and predictability, reducing anxiety.
- **Morning Routine**: Start the day with a consistent wake-up time, a healthy breakfast, and a calm start to the day.
- **Bedtime Routine**: Wind down with quiet activities like reading or listening to soft music, ensuring a consistent bedtime.

#### Safe Spaces

- **Comfort Zone**: Designate a quiet, comforting space where your child can retreat when feeling overwhelmed.
- **Personal Touch**: Let your child personalize this space with their favorite books, toys, or blankets to make it more inviting.

#### Predictable Environment

- **Clear Expectations**: Set clear expectations and rules, so your child knows what to expect and what is expected of them.
- **Visual Schedules**: Use visual schedules or charts to outline daily activities, helping your child understand and anticipate the day's events.

By creating a predictable and safe environment, you can help your child feel more secure and reduce their anxiety. For more tips on supporting your child, explore our [Parent Toolkit](#).
