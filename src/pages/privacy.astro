      household purposes, you may ask us about the information we release to
      other organizations for their marketing purposes. In accordance with your
      right to non-discrimination, we may offer you certain financial incentives
      permitted by the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the California
      Privacy Rights Act (collectively, CCPA) that can result in different
      prices, rates, or quality levels for the goods or services we provide. Any
      CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to the
      value of your personal information, and we will provide written terms that
      describe clearly the nature of such an offer. Participation in a financial
      incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke
      at any time.

      Additional Disclosures for UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR)
      Compliance (UK)
    </h3>
    <h4>Data Controller / Data Processor</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      The GDPR distinguishes between organisations that process personal
      information for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and
      organizations that process personal information on behalf of other
      organizations (known as “data processors”). For the purposes covered by
      this Privacy Policy, we are a Data Controller with respect to the personal
      information you provide to us and remain compliant with our data
      controller obligations under GDPR.
    </p>
    <h4>Third-Party Provided Content</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      We may indirectly collect personal information about you from
      third-parties who have your permission to share it. For example, if you
      purchase a product or service from a business working with us, and give
      your permission for us to use your details in order to complete the
      transaction.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      We may also collect publicly available information about you, such as from
      any social media and messaging platforms you may use. The availability of
      this information will depend on both the privacy policies and your own
      privacy settings on such platforms.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Additional Disclosure for Collection and Use of Personal Information
    </h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      In addition to the aforementioned purposes warranting the collection and
      use of personal information, we may also conduct marketing and market
      research activities, including how visitors use our site, website
      improvement opportunities and user experience.
    </p>
    <h4>Personal Information No Longer Required for Our Purposes</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      If your personal information is no longer required for our stated
      purposes, or if you instruct us under your Data Subject Rights, we will
      delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you
      (“Anonymisation”). However, if necessary, we may retain your personal
      information for our compliance with a legal, accounting, or reporting
      obligation or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific,
      or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Legal Bases for Processing Your Personal Information</h3>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Data Protection and Privacy Laws permit us to collect and use your
      personal data on a limited number of grounds.. In which case, we will
      collect and use your personal information lawfully, fairly and in a
      transparent manner. We never directly market to any person(s) under 18
      years of age.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Our lawful bases depend on the services you use and how you use them. This
      is a non-exhaustive list of the lawful bases we use:
    </p>
    <h4>Consent From You</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information for
      a specific purpose. You may withdraw your consent at any time using the
      facilities we provide; however this will not affect any use of your
      information that has already taken place. When you contact us, we assume
      your consent based on your positive action of contact, therefore you
      consent to your name and email address being used so we can respond to
      your enquiry.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Where you agree to receive marketing communications from us, we will do so
      based solely on your indication of consent or until you instruct us not
      to, which you can do at any time.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      While you may request that we delete your contact details at any time, we
      cannot recall any email we have already sent. If you have any further
      enquiries about how to withdraw your consent, please feel free to enquire
      using the details provided in the Contact Us section of this privacy
      policy.
    </p>
    <h4>Performance of a Contract or Transaction</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Where you have entered into a contract or transaction with us, or in order
      to take preparatory steps prior to our entering into a contract or
      transaction with you. For example, if you contact us with an enquiry, we
      may require personal information such as your name and contact details in
      order to respond.
    </p>
    <h4>Our Legitimate Interests</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Where we assess it is necessary for our legitimate interests, such as for
      us to provide, operate, improve and communicate our services. We consider
      our legitimate interests to include research and development,
      understanding our audience, marketing and promoting our services, measures
      taken to operate our services efficiently, marketing analysis, and
      measures taken to protect our legal rights and interests.
    </p>
    <h4>Compliance with Law</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to use or keep your personal
      information. Such cases may include (but are not limited to) court orders,
      criminal investigations, government requests, and regulatory obligations.
      For example, we are required to keep financial records for a period of 7
      years. If you have any further enquiries about how we retain personal
      information in order to comply with the law, please feel free to enquire
      using the details provided in the Contact Us section of this privacy
      policy.
    </p>
    <h4>International Transfers of Personal Information</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      The personal information we collect is stored and/or processed in the
      United Kingdom by us. Following an adequacy decision by the EU Commission,
      the UK has been granted an essentially equivalent level of protection to
      that guaranteed under UK GDPR.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      On some occasions, where we share your data with third parties, they may
      be based outside of the UK, or the European Economic Area (“EEA”). These
      countries to which we store, process, or transfer your personal
      information may not have the same data protection laws as the country in
      which you initially provided the information.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      If we transfer your personal information to third parties in other
      countries:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li>
        we will perform those transfers in accordance with the requirements of
        the UK GDPR (Article 45) and Data Protection Act 2018;
      </li>
      <li>
        we will adopt appropriate safeguards for protecting the transferred
        data, including in transit, such as standard contractual clauses
        (“SCCs”) or binding corporate rules.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Your Data Subject Rights</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      <strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You have the right to request
      that we restrict the processing of your personal information if (i) you are
      concerned about the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) you believe
      your personal information has been unlawfully processed; (iii) you need us
      to maintain the personal information solely for the purpose of a legal claim;
      or (iv) we are in the process of considering your objection in relation to
      processing on the basis of legitimate interests.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      <strong>Right to Object:</strong> You have the right to object to processing
      of your personal information that is based on our legitimate interests or public
      interest. If this is done, we must provide compelling legitimate grounds for
      the processing which overrides your interests, rights, and freedoms, in order
      to proceed with the processing of your personal information.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      <strong>Right to be Informed:</strong> You have the right to be informed with
      how your data is collected, processed, shared and stored.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      <strong>Right of Access:</strong> You may request a copy of the personal information
      that we hold about you at any time by submitting a Data Subject Access Request
      (DSAR). The statutory deadline for fulfilling a DSAR request is 30 calendar
      days from our receipt of your request.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      <strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> In certain circumstances, you can ask for
      your personal data to be erased from the records held by organisations. However
      this is a qualified right; it is not absolute, and may only apply in certain
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">When may the right to erasure apply?</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li>
        When the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which
        it was originally collected or processed for.
      </li>
      <li>
        If consent was the lawful basis for processing personal data and that
        consent has been withdrawn. Bravies relies on consent to process
        personal data in very few circumstances.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Company is relying on legitimate interests as a legal basis for
        processing personal data and an individual has exercised the right to
        object and it has been determined that the Company has no overriding
        legitimate grounds to refuse that request.
      </li>
      <li>
        Personal data are being processed for direct marketing purposes e.g. a
        person’s name and email address, and the individual objects to that
        processing.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is legislation that requires that personal data are to be
        destroyed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-2">
      <strong>Right to Portability:</strong> Individuals have the right to get some
      of their personal data from an organisation in a way that is accessible and
      machine-readable, for example as a csv file. Associated with this, individuals
      also have the right to ask an organisation to transfer their personal data
      to another organisation.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">However, the right to portability:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li>
        only applies to personal data which a person has directly given to
        Bravies in electronic form; and
      </li>
      <li>
        onward transfer will only be available where this is “technically
        feasible”.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-2">
      <strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> If personal data is inaccurate, out
      of date, or incomplete, individuals have the right to correct, update or complete
      that data. Collectively this is referred to as the right to rectification.
      Rectification may involve filling the gaps i.e. to have to have incomplete
      personal data completed – although this will depend on the purposes for the
      processing. This may involve adding a supplementary statement to the incomplete
      data to highlight any inaccuracy or claim thereof.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      This right only applies to an individual’s own personal data; a person
      cannot seek the rectification of another person’s information.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      <strong>Notification of data breaches:</strong> Upon discovery of a data breach,
      we will investigate the incident and report it to the UK’s data protection
      regulator and yourself, if we deem it appropriate to do so.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      <strong>Complaints:</strong> You have the right, at any time, to lodge a complaint
      with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority
      for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate
      the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please
      contact us in the first instance using the details below. Please provide us
      with as much information as you can about the alleged breach. We will promptly
      investigate your complaint and respond to you, in writing, setting out the
      outcome of our investigation and the steps we will take to deal with your complaint.

      Additional Disclosures for Personal Information Protection and Electronic
      Documents Act (PIPEDA) Compliance (Canada)
    </h3>
    <h4>Additional scope of personal information</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      In accordance with PIPEDA, we broaden our definition of personal
      information to include any information about an individual, such as
      financial information, information about your appearance, your views and
      opinion (such as those expressed online or through a survey), opinions
      held about you by others, and any personal correspondences you may have
      with us. While this information may not directly identify you, be aware
      that it may be combined with other information to do so.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      As PIPEDA refers to personal information using the term Personally
      Identifying Information (PII), any references to personal information and
      PII in this privacy policy, and in official communications from Bravies,
      are intended as equivalent to one another in every way, shape and form.
    </p>
    <h4>Valid Consent</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information for
      a specific purpose. You may withdraw your consent at any time using the

      your consent based on your positive action of contact, therefore you
      consent to your name and email address being used so we can respond to
      your enquiry. Under PIPEDA, consent is only valid if it is reasonable to
      expect that an individual to whom the organization's activities are
      directed would understand the nature, purpose, and consequences of the
      collection, use, or disclosure of the personal information to which they
      are consenting.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h4>International Transfers of Information</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      While Bravies endeavors to keep, store and handle customer data within
      locations in Canada, it may use agents or service providers located in the
      United States (U.S.), European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK)
      to collect, use, retain and process personal information as part of
      providing services to you. While we use all reasonable efforts to ensure
      that personal information receives the same level of security in any other
      jurisdiction as it would in Canada, please be aware that privacy
      protections under U.S. laws may not be the same adequacy.
    </p>
    <h4>Customer Data Rights</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Although PIPEDA does not contain an extensive set of consumer rights, it
      does grant consumers the right to:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li>Access the personal information organizations hold about them;</li>
      <li>
        Correct any inaccurate or outdated personal information the organization

        personal information)

      <li>
        Withdraw consent for any activities for which they have consented (e.g.

      refuse to consent, or continue to consent to the collection, use or
      disclosure of their personal information by notifying us using the email

    </p>
    <h4>Right of Access under PIPEDA</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      PIPEDA gives you a general right to access the PII held by businesses
      subject to this law. Under PIPEDA, you need to make your access request in
      writing and pay a minimal fee of $30.00.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      If any organizational fees seem unjust, you have the right to complain
      about this. We retain the right to decide how we disclose the copies of
      your PII to you. We will take all necessary measures to fulfill your
      request in 30 days from receipt, otherwise we must inform you of our
      inability to do so before the 30-day timeframe if:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li>
        meeting the time limit would unreasonably interfere with our business
        activities; or
      </li>
      <li>
        the time required to undertake consultations necessary to respond to the
        request would make it impractical to meet the time limit.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-2">
      We can also extend the time limit for the length of time required to
      convert the personal information into an alternative format. In these
      circumstances, we will advise you of the delay within the first 30 days
      and explain the reason for it.
    </p>
    <h4>Right of rectification under PIPEDA</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">
      You may request a correction to any factual errors or omissions within
      your PII. We would ask you to provide some evidence to back up your claim.
      Under PIPEDA, an organization must amend the information, as required, if
      you successfully demonstrate that it’s incomplete or inaccurate.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      You may contact us at any time, using the information provided in the
      Contact Us section of this privacy policy if you believe your PII on our
      systems is incorrect or incomplete.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      If we cannot agree on changing the information, you have the right to have
      your concerns recorded with the Office of the Privacy Commission of
      Canada.
    </p>
    <h4>Compliance with PIPEDA’s Ten Principles of Privacy</h4>

      This privacy policy complies with the PIPEDA’s requirements and ten
      principles of privacy, which are as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Accountability.</strong> Bravies is responsible for the PII under
        its control and will designate one or more persons to ensure organizational
        accountability for compliance with the ten principles of privacy under PIPEDA,
        whose details are included below. All personnel are accountable for the protection
        of customers’ personal information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Identifying purposes.</strong> Bravies identifies the purposes for
        which personal information is collected at or before the time the information
        is collected.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Consent.</strong> Consent is required for Bravies' collection, use
        or disclosure of personal information, except where required or permitted
        by PIPEDA or other law. In addition, when customers access a product or service
        offered by us, consent is deemed to be granted. Express consent may be obtained
        verbally, in writing or through electronic means. Alternatively, consent
        may be implied through the actions of customers or continued use of a product
        or service following Bravies' notification of changes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Limiting collection.</strong> Personal information collected will
        be limited to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by Bravies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Limiting use, disclosure and retention.</strong> We will not use
        or disclose personal information for purposes other than those for which
        the information was collected, except with your consent or as required by
        law. We will retain personal information only for as long as is necessary
        to fulfill the purposes for collecting such information and compliance with
        any legal requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Accuracy.</strong> Personal information will be maintained by Bravies
        in an accurate, complete and up-to-date format as is necessary for the purpose(s)
        for which the personal information was collected.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Safeguards.</strong> We will protect personal information with security
        safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of such information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Openness.</strong> We will make our policies and practices relating
        to the collection and management of personal information readily available
        upon request, including our brochures or other information that explain our
        policies, standards, or codes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Customer access.</strong> We will inform customers of the existence,
        use and disclosure of their personal information and will provide access
        to their personal information, subject to any legal restrictions. We may
        require written requests for access to personal information and in most cases,
        will respond within 30 days of receipt of such requests. Customers may verify
        the accuracy and completeness of their personal information, and may request
        the personal information be corrected or updated, if appropriate.
      </li>
